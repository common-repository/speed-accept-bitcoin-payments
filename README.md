# Speed - Accept Bitcoin payment on Woocommerce

Start accepting bitcoin or stablecoin payments instantly on your platform using Speed, without exchange rate volatility risk.

## Description

Using Speed, you can provide your customers with a user-friendly, secure, branded, and device-optimized experience for making bitcoin or stablecoin payments in just a few minutes.
You can install this plugin in your Wordpress woocommerce store and begin accepting bitcoin or stablecoin payments right away.

# Benefits of using Speed

1. Transaction fees are significantly lower (1%) than for credit cards (2.9% -3.4%).
2. There is no risk of chargebacks or fraudulent payments.
3. Accept cross-border payments without the involvement of a bank. It's simple to go global.
4. Withdraw your balance in bitcoin, stablecoin, or fiat currency.
5. There is no setup fee. Simply open your Speed account and install the plugin.
6. It's highly safe and private for you and your customer.

# How does it work?

1. The customer adds the items to their shopping cart and goes to checkout, where they choose "Bitcoin" as their checkout/payment method.
2. A QR code payment is made, which shows the amount of BTC at a locked exchange rate for 10 minutes. (For example, an item that costs 100 USD at the current BTC rate costs 0.046 BTC.)
3. Once the payment has been made, we send an instant confirmation. You'll get a message, and you can check your balance on the Speed dashboard.
4. You can withdraw BTC manually or set up payments to happen every day.
